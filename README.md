Getting and Cleaning Data Project - Greg Field - August 2014
============================================================

Background
----------

This project is to collect, work with and produce a clean data set.  The
data used is from a set of measurements related to wearable computing devices.

The data set comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The original data set can be downloaded here: [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

Approach
--------

This list outlines the general approach:

* Create a GitHub repository to store all files related to the project
* Download the data set from the web and unzip
* Write an R script to load and clean the data
* Perform exploratory analysis to understand the data set
* Create a CodeBook.md file which describes the varaibles, the data and
any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
